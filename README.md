# A mobile app for plants #
This repository contains the implementation of a mobile app, developed as a project for the Mobile Apps Development course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo. Main features include displaying the plants in various modes, adding new plants with data validation, implementing multiple search methods, and using data both from a web API and a local database. The app was implemented using the Spiral Model, with each of the four phases covering both functionality and UI requirements.
